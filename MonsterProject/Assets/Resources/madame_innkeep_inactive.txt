You remembered Marget talking about some trouble Randvi
was having, so you asked if you could help her in any way. Marget eyed you from head to toe, looking sceptical.

"Oh what the hell, what's the harm. Have you met the
old fart that reeks of fish? Doesn't really matter, but he's one bitter bastard and he owns the house Randvi and Ygge live in.

He used the house as storage when he had money from fishing,
but since he drank most of it he needed more to keep drinking so he sold it to the newly wed couple.

However, Randvi and Ygge didn't have that kind of money
so they made a deal of small monthly payments. The problem is, until the full amount has been payed, they will be treated like tenants

and if they don't pay up every month, the bastard can
just throw them out without any warning or anything. Randvi makes very pretty jewerly, but since the jackalopes have infested the area where she can find

the materials she uses to make the jewelry, she can't make
the best sellers any longer. That has really hurt their capability to pay the cranky fisherman. If that adorable creature of yours can fight, you could take care of the jackalopes!"

#OptionA
You promised to help Randvi by taking care of the jackalopes.
You knew your monster might not like it, but you needed good relations with the other villagers to be able to settle down in the charming village

"Oh and before I forget, the jackalopes are in X area.
Be careful!"
#

#OptionB
You told Marget that your creature didn't know how
to fight and apologized. She seemed quite understanding.

#ButtonA

#ButtonB
It's too dangerous
