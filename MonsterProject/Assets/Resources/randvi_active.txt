You walked next to, who you presumed to be Marget, and
introduced yourself. She snapped out of her thoughts and turned towards you.

"Oh hello there. You must be our new villager. I'm Marget,
I run the inn and the pub here in Bergensjofellbyfjord. You are welcome to visit any time."

You thanked Marget and handed her the package explaining
Randvi had sent it. You also told Randvi's message. Marget grinned and laughed.

"Oh, you sweet little Randvi. Always looking out for others
while neck deep in shit herself. Thank you for helping her out. If you come by the pub the first drink will be on the house."

You thanked Marget and told her that you'd be sure to stop
by after you get settled down. She gave you a tired smile and turned her attention to your creature.

"I had one myself, but it wouldn't have been safe to take him
here... I named him Houndr, because he looked like a hound when he evolved."

"My grandma is looking after him, which is nice. She needed
some company after grandpa died and Houndr is such a good boy."

You asked if Marget wanted to play with !MonsterName!. She
seemed delighted - her forced smile turned into a genuine one.

"Oh, I'd love to! It has been such a long time since I've seen
one of these little beauties. Who's a good little monster, hm?"

You let the two play for a while. When they finally stopped
you thanked Marget for entertaining !MonsterName! and left. You decided to report back to Randvi.
