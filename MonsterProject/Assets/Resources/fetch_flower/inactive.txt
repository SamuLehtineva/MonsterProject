"Bloody ankle... What are you looking at, kid? Is... that... a monster?"


You clarified that your companion is a creature, not a monster, and that you have raised it from an egg so it listens to your commands


"Creature, monster, what's the difference? They are all evil!"


"*Mumble mumble* First I sprain my ankle so I can't visit my son's grave and now his murderer has appeared in my yard!"


"The gods are mocking me!"


You told the old man that !MonsterName! had never hurt anyone and hadn't killed his son


"I don't care if your monster specifically didn't kill my son, but its brethren did! I know what those things are capable of... I saw it with my own eyes..."


You wondered if helping this man would change his mind. !MonsterName! hid behind your legs and glared at the fisherman.

#OptionA
You offered to go gather flowers to bring to his son's grave


First, he seemed offended that you had the audacity to even ask, but after thinking for a few seconds he mumbled something resembling a yes


"... Fine, everyone else is too busy... But don't you let that thing go anywhere close to Sven's grave!"


"If I find even one paw print in the graveyard I will chase you out of this fine village the second my ankle heals! Understood?"


You nodded quickly and left before the old man would get even angrier. !MonsterName! let out an angry growl. They didn't seem to like the fisherman.

#OptionB
You decided to leave the man alone. It's probably for the best
