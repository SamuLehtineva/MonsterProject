"Bloody ankle... What are you looking at, kid?
Is... that... a monster?"

You clarified that your companion is a creature, not a
monster, and that you have raised it from an egg so it listens to your commands

"They are the same thing! All monsters are the same..."


"*Mumble mumble* First I sprain my ankle so I can't visit
my sons grave and now the thing responsible for his death has appeared in my yard!"

"The gods are mocking me!"


You told the old man that !MonsterName! had never hurt
anyone and hadn't killed his son

"I don't care if your monster specificly didn't kill my son,
but it's brothers did. I know what those things are capable of!"

You wondered if helping this man would change his mind
#

#OptionA
You offered to go gather flowers to bring to the son's grave


First he seemed offended that you had the audacity to ask,
but after thinking for a few seconds he mumbled something resembling a yes

"... Fine, everyone else is too busy... But don't you let that
thing go anywhere close to Sven's grave!"

"If I find even one paw print in the graveyard I will chase
you out of this fine village!"

You decided to leave the man alone. It's probably for the best
