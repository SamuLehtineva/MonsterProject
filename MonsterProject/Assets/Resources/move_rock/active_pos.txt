You stopped by Margets house to ask her if she would help Jens with moving the rock since your arm muscles were too weak. She seemed confused.


"Umm... I guess I could? But he's... he's the son of that grumpy old man... I'm quite confused if I'm being honest."


"Why are you asking me to help him? If he needed help why didn't he just ask me himself?"


You explained that Jens seems to like her and is probably too anxious to ask himself since he knows how much she hated his father.


"He likes me? That's odd, you'd think he hated me as much as his father does."


You told her that Jens actually seemed to disagree with his father and side with her for exaple with Houndr. Marget raised her eyebrows.


"Really now? Hmm... So the old man is so grumpy even his own son is against him. Facinating."


"... Fine. Let's see what Jens is all about. This might be quite interesting. And if nothing else comes from this, at least I know it will piss off angry grandpa!"
