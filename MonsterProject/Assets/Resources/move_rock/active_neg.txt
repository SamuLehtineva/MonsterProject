You stopped by Margets house to ask her if she would help Jens with moving the rock since your arm muscles were too weak. She seemed confused.


"Umm... I guess I could? But he's... he's the son of that grumpy old man... I'm quite confused if I'm being honest."


"Why are you asking me to help him? If he needed help why didn't he just ask me himself?"


You explained that Jens seems to like her and is probably too anxious to ask himself since he knows how much she hated his father.


"He likes me? I don't belive that. He should hate me as much as his father does."


You told her that Jens actually seemed to disagree with his father and side with her for exaple with Houndr. Marget raised her eyebrows.


"So the old man is so grumpy even his own son is against him. Facinating, yet somehow hard to belive. I bet one word from his father and the boy will whimper in fear."


"But no, I'm not interested in helping anyone from that family. They can all go fishing and drown in a storm, I wouldn't shed a tear."
