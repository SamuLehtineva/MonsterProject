#Start
You walked past a man rubbing his right temple. He was glaring at a rock in the middle of his yard. You asked if he was okay.


"Hm? Me? Yes, I'm fine, I guess. I came from the pub last night and tripped over this stupid rock... Too bad it's just heavy enough that I can't move it alone."


"Mind lending me a hand? My father is too old to help me and I don't want to bother Marget... o-or any other of my neighbours."

You told the young man that you didn't have the arm strenght to even consider helping but !MonsterName! could try and lift the rock.


"Hmm... Yeah, that could actually work. Let's see what this thing is capable of."
