Bloody ankle... What are you looking at, kid?
Is... that... a monster?

...
...

It doesn't matter if you raised that thing, it's a monster.
* Mumble mumble* First I sprain my ankle so I can't visit my sons grave and now the thing responsible for his death has appeared in my yard!

The gods are mocking me!


...
...

I don't care if your monster specificly didn't kill my son,
a monster is a monster, no matter what...

(You wonder if helping this man would change his mind)

#OptionA
You offer to go gather flowers to bring to the son's grave
First he seemed offended that you had the audacity to ask, but after thinking for a few seconds he mumbled something resembling a yes

"... Fine, everyone else is too busy... But don't you let that
thing go anywhere close to Sven's grave! If I find even one paw print in the graveyard I will chase you out of this fine village!"
#

#OptionB
You decided to leave the man alone. It's probably for the best
