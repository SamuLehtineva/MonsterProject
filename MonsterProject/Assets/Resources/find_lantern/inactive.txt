"Hey, it's you again! Heh, this is a bit awkward but could you help please help me again? I lost our lantern and we need it back before the sun sets."


"It's just... I don't want to leave my old mother alone for long. She hasn't really been herself lately..."


You turned to take a look at the girl's mother who was standing in front of a bench, looking into the horizon with a blank gaze. She looked tired.


Slowly she moved her head and looked at you. She gave you a gentle smile, so subtle you might have just imagined it, but when she saw !MonsterName! something changed.


"M-m-monster! Kill it!"


She picked up a rock and threw it at !MosnterName!. Luckily, it dodged the rock and hid behind your legs. Shocked, you took a few steps back.


"Mother! Don't hurt them! It's not a monster! I'm so sorry, she fought in the war with my father and-"


"They attacked him... His screams... I can still hear him screaming... Until they bit his neck and ripped it open... Those monsters... I will... kill them"

#OptionA
You apologized and left before the old lady would pick up another rock. You could not count on her missing again.
#

#OptionB
You promised to help them out and find the lantern. You left swiftly to not upset the old lady any further.


!MonsterName! was visibly shaken after the encounter and you knew it wouldn't appreciate you going back
