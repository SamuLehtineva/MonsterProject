Hi neighbour! Welcome to our little village! I hope you like it
here! I know this is strange but could I get some water from your well?
#

#OptionA
You told your new neighbour she can take as much as she needs


"Thank you so much! Here, some coin for your trouble."
#

#OptionB
You told her that the water was yours and yours alone. 


"Oh... O-okay? I'm sorry I bothered you."


She looked astonished by your rude demeanor. You turned
around and continued onwards.

#ButtonA
Of course
#

#ButtonB
Umm.. no?
