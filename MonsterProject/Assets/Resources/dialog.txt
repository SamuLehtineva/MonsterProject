"Hi, neighbour! My name is Inger. Oh... you have a mon- I mean a creature as your companion?


... N-nice! Um, I thought you might be hungry after moving so I bought some vegetables! Do you want to buy some?
#

#OptionA
You told your neighbour you'd love to buy some food.


"Okay! I have a bundle of carrots, potatoes and a few cabbages. What do you want?"


After buying some food and talking with Inger about the village you continued onwards. 


!MonsterName! didn't seem to enjoy Inger's company.
#

#OptionB
You thanked your neighbour and told her you didn't need more food. You also ensured her that !MonsterName! was a kind creature before you left.


!MonsterName! seemed relieved that you continued onwards.
