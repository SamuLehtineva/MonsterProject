"Hey, new guy! Welcome to Bergensjofellbyfjord!
Oh... You have a creature as your companion? Hmm...

A word of advice, we have a bloody history with creatures.
Folks here won't give you a warm welcome, not with that thing following you around.

...
...

Your creature is harmless you say? Hm. You do know that it
can turn into a monster if you don't treat and raise it well, right? Newcomers word won't count for much...

I know! You could help folks out to earn their trust and
you can start by helping me! My beloved Helga ran into the forest and hasn't come back.

I'll pay you if you bring her back in one piece with that
creature of yours and on top of that I will tell people that this creature is a kind one. Deal?"
