"Hey! You are the new guy, right? Welcome to Bergensj√∂fellbyfjord!
Oh... You have a creature as your companion? Hmm...

I need to warn you, we have a bloody history with those creatures.
Folks here won't give you a warm welcome, not with that thing with you.

...
...

Your creature is harmless you say? Hm. You do know that it can turn into a monster
if you don't treat and raise it well, right? Newcomers word won't count for much...

I know! You could help folks out to earn their trust and you can start by helping me!
My beloved Helga ran into the forest and hasn't come back.

I'll pay you if you bring her back in one piece with that creature of yours and
on top of that I will tell people that this creature is a kind one. Deal?"
