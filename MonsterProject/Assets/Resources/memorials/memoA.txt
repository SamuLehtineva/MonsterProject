#Start
The last stand of our courageous warriors where they slayed the remaining monsters and sent them to the depths of Niflheim!

We lost Sven, Galle and Rakel in this battle. May they eat and drink in Valhalla!


Fernirs soldiers were defeated and no monster will dare to attack Bergensjofellbyfjord ever again!


The coward ran back to which ever hole it crawled out of and it is our duty to make sure no monster survives to free that filth ever again.
